# General Overview

Each of our VAW games is developed as a standalone project, and certain games may have been prioritized over others. As a result, you may notice some differences between the projects. We appreciate your understanding in this matter, and we assure you that we are committed to continuously updating and improving our projects to meet and exceed your expectations in the coming months. Thank you for your support and patience.

## Configuration Before Launching Any Game

### Sensors

Before launching any game, ensure the following configurations:

### Sensors:

1. **Heart Rate Monitoring**
    - Wear a heart belt with ANT+ connectivity. We recommend the [Garmin HRM-PRO](https://www.garmin.com/en-NZ/p/682155) for accurate tracking of heart rate and calories burned. Some games may require additional sensors.

**Best practices**

- Have your PC connected to Router/Access Point via Ethernet cable
- Headset should be connected to Wi-Fi via 5GHz band (AC or AX)
- Router in the same room as the headset or in line-of-sight, and at least 1m off the ground
- Air Link works best with non-mesh network configuration

**Set up Air Link**
